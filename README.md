# CALM GitHub Copilot AI-Assistant Demo

This repository demonstrates the **FINOS Common Architecture Language Model (CALM)** integration with GitHub Copilot AI-Assistant.

## About

CALM is a declarative, JSON-based modeling language used to describe complex systems, particularly in regulated environments like financial services and cloud architectures. This demo showcases how GitHub Copilot can assist in creating, modifying, and understanding CALM architecture models.

## What's Inside

- **Architecture Model**: Sample CALM architecture definition (`docs/sample_ghcp.architecture.json`)
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated architecture documentation using CALM tooling
- **Examples**: Demonstrations of nodes, relationships, interfaces, and other CALM components

## CALM Components Demonstrated

- **Nodes** – System components (services, databases, user interfaces)
- **Relationships** – Connections and interactions between components
- **Interfaces** – Communication patterns and schemas
- **Flows** – Business processes across the architecture
- **Controls** – Compliance policies and enforcement mechanisms
- **Metadata** – Supplemental architectural annotations

## Getting Started

The GitHub Copilot CALM AI-Assistant can help you:

1. Create new CALM architecture models
2. Add nodes, relationships, and interfaces
3. Validate models against CALM schema (release/1.0)
4. Generate documentation from your architecture
5. Apply best practices for architecture modeling

## CALM Schema Version

This repository uses CALM schema version: **release/1.0**
